This year for the course APCSA, students will be working on their freedom project. The freedom project is a year-long project where students will implement different tools to create applications. We will also be using Java to code the fundamentals for this project and create a solution to an existing problem that hinders the daily lives of individuals.

I plan on using the tools: Swift and Firebase to create a productivity app that will provide students with an application that helps them with their time management. [Swift](https://swift.org/about/#swiftorg-and-open-source) is used to help create mobile and desktop applications, which is great for creating an IOS app. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) is used to store data of user inputs. The skills I use so far consist of my creativity, consideration, and being able to read documentation. 

Based on the Engineering Design Process (EDP), I am currently on step 1: define the problem. I will continue to learn more about the tools that I will be using to create the project. My next steps are to research more about my tools and create implications.
